# 🎯 Student Pass/Fail Prediction using Logistic Regression

This is a mini machine learning project that uses **logistic regression** to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on:

- 🕒 Hours Studied  
- 📈 Attendance Percentage

## 🧠 What’s Inside

- 📊 Manually created dataset (no external CSV required)
- 🧪 Model training using `scikit-learn`
- ✅ Accuracy evaluation
- 📉 Visualizations (Scatter plot + Decision boundary)
- 🔍 Prediction on new inputs
